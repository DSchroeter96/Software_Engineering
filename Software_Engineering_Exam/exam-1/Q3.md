# Question 3: Good code practice and debugging [15 points]

You are working on a school project with your friend, and you receive this code snippet:

```scala
// Note: leave the prints as I am still testing this code !!!!

object Main {
    val interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser = new CommandInterpreter

    // Use the correct function when needed
    private def handleArguments(stringOfArgumenGivenByUser: String): Int = {
        // splits the parameter with a ',' and turns it into a list
        val theArrayFromTheArgumentThatWeSplit = stringOfArgumenGivenByUser.split(" ").toList
        theArrayFromTheArgumentThatWeSplit match
            case "--execute" :: xs =>
                println(s"Argument of execute: $xs")
                // give the arguments of execute to the interpreter so that it can execute
                interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser.execute(xs)
            case "--fetch" :: xs =>
                println(s"Argument of fetch: $xs")
                // give the arguments of fetch to the interpreter so that it can fetch what's needed
                interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser.fetch(xs)
            // This method is not yet functional in CommandInterpreter yet
            // Please live it commented for later uses
            /*
            case "--export" :: filename :: _ =>
                // give the filename of where to export to the interpreter so that it can export at the correct location
                interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser.export(filename)
            */
            case _ =>
                println("Command not found.")
                // in other cases, ask the interpreter to show help
                interpreterOfTheArgumentsGivenByTheUser.showHelp()
    }


    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
        // loop on the arguments to handle everything
        for {
            argumentFromTheArray <- args
        } do {
            handleArguments(argumentFromTheArray)
        }

    }
}
```

Your friend uses `print` to debug his code. Is this a good idea and, regardless of whether it is bad or not,
is there a better way to do it? Explain why or why not in max 2 sentences. [3 points]
> Using print to debug is generaly not a good idea no. A better way to do it would be to add some mark that delimit the comments to find more easily what is happening when everything gets printed on the consol. For example adding `println("=============================================")` above the comments to split them.

Your friend claims that the names are good because they describe exactly what is going on. Do you agree? Explain in max
2 sentences. [4 points]
> No the namae are not particularly good, it does indeed describe precisely what they are doing, but they are too long and make the function or variable difficult to understand.

In order to make the code easier to understand, your friend added comments. Are they correctly used? Explain in max 2
sentences. [4 points]
> Comment should tell `what` and `why`, not how. Most of the comments just tells how it does it without really telling the purpose of the line.

Your friend insists that the commented-out case not be touched for now, because the class `CommandInterpreter` will soon
be updated. Think of what your friend is trying to accomplish, and suggest an alternate way to achieve the same
objective in max 2 sentences. [4 points]
> He is trying to anticipate future work. Instead of doing it like that, he could create a separate branch and start working on it for a future feature.
