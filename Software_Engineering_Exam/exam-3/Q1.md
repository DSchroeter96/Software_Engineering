# Question 1 [11 points]

You are working in a company on the back-end of a mobile application.


Your code crashes with a `MaxSpotFleetRequestCountExceeded` error.
Who is your web service provider?

> Our web service provider is Amazone AWS.


One colleague explains that the team had originally configured the repo so that only code with >80% path coverage
could be merged, but have now dropped this requirement.
In one sentence, give one possible reason behind this removal.

> Maybe some path were waiting on user input and infinitely looping, and therefore the coverage for those path where user input is required is 0%.


You are tasked with improving the integration of the authentication via Google in your app, but your manager tells you:
```
Don't run any tests today, we only have a few API calls left for today's rate limit, we need to preserve those for customers.
```
In 1-2 sentences, propose a change to the codebase to avoid this problem.

> The test should not be written with real call to the API. Instead we should do mock testing, by injecting the dependence so that we can inject a custom authenticationService only for testing purpose, and therefore not waist any call to the real authenticationService API.
