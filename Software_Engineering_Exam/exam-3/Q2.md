# Question 2 [12 points]

You get complaints from Android users: when rotating the phone, the text they had typed disappears.
In one sentence, explain what the likely root cause is.

> The likely root cause, is that the text position was not properly configured, and was therefore not responsive to different screen size


You meet a client while out for coffee, who tells you:
``` 
I noticed it's not possible to customize the profile picture.
I know you have a lot of stuff to do this sprint,
but my boss is threatening to switch to another app,
could you get this fixed during this sprint? 
```
In one sentence, give an answer that helps both you and the client.

> I reply to the client that unfortunately, it is not possible to modify the current sprint backelog, but that I will speak with the product owner, to tell him that he should add this features with
> the highest priority in the backlog, so that we implement it next sprint.


Your team's graphic designer tells you:
```
I wanted the logo to be exactly 250 pixels wide, but on my new phone it's not.
This is a bug that needs fixing!
```
In one sentence, explain whether you agree with the designer's assessment and why.

> I disagree, because as there is many possible screen resolution, if we fix the size of a logo in terme of absolut size, it is only going to render well on particular devices and not on all of them. Whe should use relative size.
