# Question 3 [15 points]

Users report that your app freezes when they access its image gallery, which shows images in a scrollable grid.
This is the function run to display the gallery:
```java
void startImageGallery() {
    // Download all the user's images from the application server
    List<Image> images = getImages();
    // Display the first few images
    displayImage(images);
    // Initialize the behavior of the exit button, back button, zoom button, etc.
    startComponentBehavior();
}
```

In one sentence, explain why the application is freezing:

> Because `getImages()` is fetching images form the application server, it takes time, and as it is running synchronously the app will freez while waiting on the response.


Users complain that your app's image gallery uses too much of their mobile data.
In one sentence, explain the first step towards improving this:

> The first step could be to lazy load images, so that we only load images on demand. It is lickely that the user will not look at all his images every time, so it will reduce his mobile data usage.


In the daily standup, you mention you are having issues with JavaFX.
Before you can give more details, your team's JavaFX expert tells you to leave it at that and instead pass by her office afterwards.
The Scrum Master disagrees and asks you to give more details.
In one sentence, explain whether your Scrum Master is taking the right approach and why.

> The Scum Master is taking the wrong approche, the daily standup is meant to be short and only focus on what each person have done yesterday, will do today, and on what they are sutck on. But if anyone has an idea to help about a blocking task, they should meet afterward to talk in private about it.
