# Question 1 [8 points]

You are part of a team developing a mobile app using Scrum.

At the last sprint planning, you were assigned the task of adding a new authentication method.
However, a customer representative just sent you an email: the representative believes authentication
is less important than support for right-to-left languages, and would like you to work on that instead.
Explain in 1 sentence what you should do:

> You should tell him that it is not possible to modify the sprint backlog once the sprint has started. And tell the product owner to schedule it for the next sprint.

One of your colleagues, who was tasked with adding a “dark mode” to the app, has found an unrelated bug during testing:
a race condition occasionally causes stale data to be displayed. Your colleague wants to immediately fix it,
though the source of the bug is not clear and it is unknown how often this actually occurs.
Explain in 1 sentence whether that is a good idea and why or why not.

> No it is not a good idea, because it seems that the bug won't be easy to fix. Instead he should tell the product owner, so that he can add a bug fix ticket in 
> the backlog to be scheduled in one of the following sprint.
